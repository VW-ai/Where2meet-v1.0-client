## Keyword Cannibalization Analysis

### Potential Overlaps Identified

**None!** Each scenario page targets:

- **Different audience segment**
- **Different primary keywords**
- **Different search intent context**

### Cross-Linking Strategy

Safe to cross-link between:

- Remote team offsite ↔ Startup cofounder (both business, different scale)
- Friends dinner ↔ College alumni (both social, different formality)
- Family reunion ↔ Sports practice (both personal logistics)

**Avoid linking:** Pages targeting same query type (even if different keywords)

---

## Content Gap Analysis

### Queries We're NOT Targeting (Yet)

**Why:** Too generic = high competition, or not enough volume

- "where to meet in the middle" - HIGH competition, generic
- "midpoint calculator" - HIGH competition, commoditized
- "central meeting point" - Too generic, many existing tools
- "meet halfway" - Very high competition, generic

**Strategy:** Focus on long-tail, scenario-specific queries instead

---

## Search Volume Estimates Legend

- **High:** 1,000+ monthly searches
- **Medium:** 100-1,000 monthly searches
- **Low:** 10-100 monthly searches
- **Very Low:** <10 monthly searches

**Note:** Low volume is OK for long-tail strategy. These are high-intent users.

---

## Competition Assessment Legend

- **Very Low:** <10 quality pages targeting this exact query
- **Low:** 10-50 quality pages
- **Medium:** 50-200 quality pages
- **High:** 200+ quality pages, established brands

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Validate 8 scenario pages have no keyword overlap
2. Create content for 8 scenario pages (1000-1500 words each)
3. Add competitive FAQ to existing FAQ page
4. Strengthen How It Works with comparison content

### Future Expansion (Month 3+)

**Monitor Google Search Console for:**

- Actual queries users search
- Pages gaining traction
- Keyword opportunities we missed

**Add pages based on data:**

- Maximum 2-3 new scenarios per quarter
- Always validate no keyword overlap first
- Quality over quantity

---

## Sources & Methodology

**Keyword Research Tools:**

- Google Keyword Planner (estimate data)
- Google Search Console (current performance)
- Manual competitor analysis (where2meet.net, meetways, etc.)
- User interview insights (if available)

**Volume Estimates:**

- Based on related keyword clusters
- Conservative estimates for new/niche queries
- Focus on intent quality over volume quantity

---

## Version History

- **2025-12-30:** Initial search intent map created
- Maps 50+ queries across intent types
- Finalizes 8 scenario pages for Phase 1
- Zero keyword cannibalization confirmed
